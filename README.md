# Theory and Empirical Research (TEWA) â€“ Neuroimaging
Teaching material for the TEWA2 seminar at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna.

Focus: Reproducable fMRI analysis using Python

## Goals
<ul>
  <li>Learn the basics of the Python programming language as well as of software libaries commonly used in research (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
  <li>Get a basic understanding of fMRI preprocessing and analysis. Cave: The goal of the course is not necessarily that you will be able to independently perform a full-fledged state-of-the-art fMRI analysis. Rather, we focus on teaching the basics, learning how to get help etc. All of this as reproducible as possible
  <li>Becoming familiar with the NiPy framework as well as other neuroimaging software tools
</ul>


## Contents
Besides basic Python skills the main focus lies on the analysis of MRI data, including the basics of...
<ul>
  <li>Understanding what MRI data is and how it represented on our computers
  <li>Creating reproducible preprocessing workflows
  <li>Performing First & Second level analysis
  <li>Visualizing and reporting results
</ul>
