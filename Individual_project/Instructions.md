# TEWA WS 22/23 â€“ Individual Assignments

The goal of the individual assignment is to look at preprocessed data, perform simple first-level analysis and assess the quality of the model fit.
We will use the "NYU Slow Flanker" dataset from OpenNeuro. In this study, 26 healthy adults underwent MRI scanning while performing an event-related Eriksen Flanker task.

We provide you with a Juypyter notebook here on GitHub (individual-project-scaffold.ipynb), which contains the the download of the sample dataset. Furthermore, there are more in depth instructions on the different steps.


<ul>
  <li>Setting up a directory structure and define experiment variables
  <li>Performing some simple sanity checks on the data I preprocessed
  <li>Performing first-fevel analysis
    <ul ul>
      <li>t-test
      <li>F-test
    </ul>
  <li>Assessing the quality of your model fit
</ul>

While the first-level analysis remains rather simple, some aspects are new to you. The notebook with the scaffold will provide you with more information for these aspects.

Please hand-in a notebook (.ipynb file) containing the whole procedure. Also, add some explanations by using text fields. While I added code cells to the notebook with the scaffold, these are only there to help you get an overview over the steps - You can add as many as you want.

Once you download the dataset, you get a folder with the raw data for each subject and a folder called "derivatives" which contains preprocessed functional and anatomical images as well as motion parameters.

You will find additional information in the notebook.
